* markdown is like HTML but cleaner
* markdown is how we write documents in easy and clean way
* used all over Github!
* it's good to practice writing different kinds of code too
### Symbols/Features
* hashtag \# is for headings
  * lots of hashtags \#\#\#\# is for h4
* start \* is for bullet points
* \` for code sections
### Questions about Markdown
* Why does the code contain a slash in front of \#?
  * to the computer, a \# means you're going to put a heading
  * we don't want a heading, we just want to show the \# for our notes
  * So, we add a \\ to the code to escape the character
